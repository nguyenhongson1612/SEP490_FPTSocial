II. Testing Documentation
1. Scope of Testing
1.1. Testing Objective
    1.1.1. Functional Testing
- Team members focus on the functions of the actor to be tested and executed.
    1.1.2. Non-Functional Testing
-          Usability:
?        Reducing the number of user actions to interact with the screen enhances the system's user-friendliness.
?        Verify errors during interactions and provide on-screen feedback messages for users.
-          Security:
?        The user account is authorized, allowing access to features corresponding to their role.
-          Maintainability:
?        The source code structure is intentionally organized to facilitate maintenance and extensibility.
1.2. Testing Scope
            	Scope of testing the FPT eLIS include:
-          Features: Check each feature of the FUSP application
-    Bug types and severities: List functional, content, visual, usability error types by low, medium, high severity.
-          Requested devices: Using multi devices such as laptop, pc, etc.. to check responsive

2. Test Strategy
       In general, the FPT eLIS project follows the V-model testing for software testing to accommodate frequent changes in customer requirements. Additionally, due to regular interaction between the development team and the customer, promptly addressing issues and bugs is crucial.
       
       
2.1 Testing Types

       The different types of testing that will be carried out this project are:
? Functional Testing: We execute functional testing to test functions and check
       if each function is correct or not.
? GUI Testing: We execute user interface testing, including some features such
       as colour, spell, background, component, and resolution of screen
? API Testing: We execute API testing to test the API of back-end services and
       check if the data the Front-end service receive is true or not
