2. Product Background
Currently, digital platforms like X, Facebook, Instagram, Threads,... exploit user information without permission for advertising and illegally trade personal user data. These actions violate Decree 13/2023/NĐ-CP on Personal Data Protection in Vietnam, as well as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe regarding cross-border data transfer.
Therefore, we aim to build an internal platform to connect current students, alumni, faculty, and staff through FPTU's internal application systems. This platform will facilitate the connection of students from different campuses, enhancing the sharing of knowledge across FPTU campuses.
FPT University Société place is a dynamic platform designed to foster a connected and collaborative community among its staff and students. This innovative website allows users to create profiles, connect with peers, and share a wide range of content, from personal updates to academic articles and professional insights. By facilitating the exchange of ideas and information, the platform aims to enhance communication, support academic and professional development, and build a vibrant, engaged university community. Whether it's faculty sharing research findings, students discussing projects, or staff announcing events, the site serves as a central hub for the diverse voices of FPT University, promoting a culture of learning, innovation, and mutual support.

To encourage and increase interaction on this platform, we hope that FPTU will implement a process or organize events that incentivize students to write articles with monetary rewards (approved by FPTU PR internal). This will enhance the quality and expertise of the content, including articles on professional topics, technical skills, communication, and creative start-up ideas.

4. Business Opportunity
The FPT University Société presents a significant business opportunity by addressing the evolving communication needs of academic institutions. By offering a centralised platform for students and staff to connect, share articles, and collaborate, the website can enhance the university's internal communication infrastructure, making it more efficient and engaging. This platform can be expanded to include features like virtual study groups, professional networking opportunities, and academic resource sharing, creating a comprehensive digital ecosystem. Additionally, the website can serve as a model for other educational institutions seeking similar solutions, opening avenues for partnerships and licensing. With the increasing emphasis on digital transformation in education, this platform positions FPT University as a leader in innovative campus communication, potentially attracting more students and staff who value a connected and supportive academic environment.

By integrating advanced features such as real-time messaging, personalised content feeds, and collaborative tools, we aspire to support a dynamic exchange of knowledge and ideas. Our ultimate goal is to empower every member of the FPT University community with seamless access to information, resources, and networking opportunities, driving innovation and excellence in education.
With this system, we propose incorporating the following features:
● Near/Real-Time Messaging and Notifications.
● Event Management.
