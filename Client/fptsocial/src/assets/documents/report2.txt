II. Project Management Plan
1. Overview
1.1 Scope & Estimation
Scope:
● The project must be completed in August 2024.
● Only used within FPT University.
● Develop a comprehensive platform for student interaction including personalized profiles, study groups, messaging, and content management.
● Enhance the quality of educational content and streamline communication among students and staff.
Estimation:
This section provides a structured view of a project's scope, breaking it down into manageable Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) items. Each WBS item represents a specific task or User Story within the project. Complexity levels (simple, medium, complex) and the estimated effort in man-days are assigned to these items.

2. Management Approach
2.1 Project Process

Methodology: Iterative and Incremental Development
Development is divided into multiple iterations, each delivering a functional product increment.
Each iteration includes requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment.

2.2 Quality Management

Approach NameDetailQuality ObjectivesUse case reviewDiscuss with members to identify inappropriate use cases	Ensure logical implementation without redundant use cases.UI reviewPrototype and review UI before client-side developmentEnsure UI is visually appealing, clean, and consistent.Unit testExecute test for all functionsHigh code coverage, catch errors early, provide documentation for the codebase.Integration testTest feature flows and interactions between components	Ensure correct data flow, manage dependencies, handle errors during integration.System testTest complete system across different environments and devicesEnsure system functionality, compatibility, and performance across various platforms.Acceptance TestFinal user tests before release	Verify functional and non-functional requirements, user interface, security, and interoperability.

6.2 Document Management
❖ Project documents are archived on Google Shared Drives with this structure:
● Root
○ SEP490_G3
■ Report
         Report_Test
■ Biên bản họp
■ Guilde làm việc
■ Bug_Report
■ Tài liệu sample
6.3 Source Code Management
❖ Source Code is managed with this structure:
➢ Schedule will be updated instantly when changes are made.
➢ Development team uses the Gitlab repository to archive source code and Git to control versions.
➢ Using JIRA, Google Sheet to resolve bugs and issues throughout the entire software development process.
➢ Developers have to run the unit test completely before push to remote repository and create merge requests.
